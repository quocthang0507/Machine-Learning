Neural networks can be used for both regression and categorisation applications. Recent advances with storage, processing power, and open-source tools have allowed many successful applications of neural networks in medical diagnosis, filtering explicit content, speech recognition and machine translation.\n\nIn this exercise we will compare three dog breeds, using their age, weight, and height. We will make a neural network model to classify the breeds of the dogs based on these features.\n\nNote: It's extremely common for AI practitioners to use a template such as the one below for making neural networks quickly. After you are done, feel free to play around with the template to get a feel of how you can easily adjust a neural network to your problems using Keras."

But that is not the case here.\n\nTo allow the neural network to predict categories properly we represent categories as one-hot vectors. The labels (dog breeds) will go from being represented as `0`, `1`, and `2` to this:\n\n| breed 0 | breed 1 | breed 2 |\n|:------- |:------- |:------- |\n| `1 0 0` | `0 1 0` | `0 0 1` |\n\nSo the if the 1 is in the first position, the neural network knows that it's breed 0.\n\nIf the 1 is in the second position, the neural network knows that it's breed 1, and so on."
